# TrashDataModel

# Context
The State Water Board’s Office of Information Management and Analysis (OIMA) is developing a new method to monitor and assess the quantity, distribution, and makeup of trash on streets to better understand the amount of trash entering (or being prevented from entering) California’s water bodies. OIMA has been working on a pilot project in partnership with the City of West Sacramento to develop a proof-of-concept tool that identifies and classifies trash in images using a customized computer vision model for trash identification, built on open-source machine learning resources and trained using a large library of images gathered from a street sweeper-mounted camera pointing at street curbs and gutters.

# Management Questions
- How much trash is entering our water bodies?
- What type of trash is in the waters?
- What can we learn by analyzing trash data over space and time?

# Problem
While a data model has been developed, there is plenty of more work to do! We need to streamline the current data model, develop a corresponding data schema, and develop a way to integrate (1) data across temporal and geographic scales and (2) monitoring methods for trash, debris and microplastics, etc.

# 2019 California Water Boards Science Symposium: Water Science Datathon
# Challenge Questions
DATA MODEL: 
- How would you revise/improve upon the data model?
- What else would be interesting to incorporate into the data model?  
- What information is needed to make a more robust and accurate data model for trash identification and classification?
- How do we integrate data across spatial and geographic scales?
- How do we integrate the varied monitoring methods for trash, debris, microplastics, etc.?

DATA SCHEMA: 
- How do we go from a data model to a useful data schema?
- What kinds of fields are present in each table and how they are organized?
- How are the fields in each table defined (e.g. data types and definitions)?

# Potential Challenge Tasks
Add to or revise the current data model. 
- Develop a list of elements to add, and how to link them to the rest of the data model. 
- Develop a list of elements to remove from data model, if necessary. 
- Define organization, relationships, and dependencies among data elements.

Develop data schema
- Define tables (what fields are in each table?)
- Define fields within each table (What are the data types and definitions for each field?)

Develop a list of data gaps. What data do we need to move forward on this project?

Provide an update on the project. How far did you get? What challenges did you face? How did you overcome these challenges or what do you need to do so?
